I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I\u2019ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"}];n(11);var d=function(){var e=l.map((function(e,t){return Object(s.jsx)(c,{index:t,cardColor:e.cardColor,img:e.img,firstname:e.firstname,name:e.name,status:e.status,resume:e.resume,quote:e.quote},e.id)}));return Object(s.jsx)("section",{className:"Container",children:Object(s.jsx)("div",{className:"Row",children:e})})};var m=function(){return Object(s.jsxs)("div",{className:"App",children:[Object(s.jsx)(d,{}),Object(s.jsxs)("div",{className:"attribution",children:[Object(s.jsxs)("p",{children:["Challenge by ",Object(s.jsx)("a",{href:"https://www.frontendmentor.io?ref=challenge",target:"_blank",rel:"noreferrer",children:"Frontend Mentor"}),"."]}),Object(s.jsxs)("p",{children:["Coded by ",Object(s.jsx)("a",{href:"https://github.com/haydee75",target:"_blank",rel:"noreferrer",children:"Haydee"}),"."]})]})]})},h=function(e){e&&e instanceof Function&&n.e(3).then(n.bind(null,13)).then((function(t){var n=t.getCLS,a=t.getFID,r=t.getFCP,i=t.getLCP,o=t.getTTFB;n(e),a(e),r(e),i(e),o(e)}))};o.a.render(Object(s.jsx)(r.a.StrictMode,{children:Object(s.jsx)(m,{})}),document.getElementById("root")),h()}],[[12,1,2]]]);
